There are three paths to creating an account on an OpenCore site:

1) The new user registers an account through the website
2) An existing project administrator sends a "Join Project" invitation to an unrecognized contact
3) Someone sends an email to the website from an unrecognized contact

In all cases, the Confirmation Workflow requires that the user confirm that he owns the claimed
email address in order to activate his new account.  He does this by clicking on an unguessable
link in an email that is sent directly to the claimed email address.  But the details of this 
workflow will vary based on the entry path.

There is also a fourth path that will trigger a Confirmation Workflow:

4) An existing active user with a confirmed email address adds a new email address to his account

== (1) Self-Registration through the Website ==

1) An anonymous user visits the ``registration_register`` view
2) He is presented with a registration form which requires: username, email, password
3) The email he provides must not already be associated with an existing account
4) A new, inactive account is created
5) A new, unconfirmed email contact is created and joined to the account
6) An email is sent to the provided address containing an unguessable link
7) The user clicks on the link
8) The system confirms that the contact referenced by the link is unconfirmed; that the
   associated account is inactive; and that the associated account has a password set
9) The user's contact becomes confirmed; his account becomes active; and he is logged in
   immediately
0) Any DeferredMessages associated with the now-confirmed Contact are reprocessed

== (2) Email Invitation from a Project Administrator ==

1) An authenticated project admin visits the ``project_manage_team`` view
2) He types in one or more email addresses to invite to his project, and an optional message
3) If the email address is associated with an existing confirmed contact, a standard Project
   Invite or Project Invite Reminder is issued to the accountholder
4) If the email address is associated with an existing unconfirmed contact, SOMETHING MUST
   HAPPEN WHICH IS NOT YET DREAMT OF IN MY PHILOSOPHY (i.e. a Confirmation Reminder Workflow)
5) If the email address is not associated with any contact in the system, proceed!
6) A new, inactive account is created with a random username and no usable password
7) A Project Invite object is created for the new account
8) An email is sent to the provided address containing an unguessable link and the message
   from the project administrator
9) The user clicks on the link
0) The system confirms that the contact referenced by the link is unconfirmed; that the
   associated account is inactive; and that the associated account does not have a password set
1) The user is presented with a form where he can set a username and password for his new 
   account, or log in to an existing account and add this email address to that account
2) If the user sets a username and password for his new account, the user's username and password
   are set; the contact becomes confirmed; his account becomes active; and he is logged in
   immediately
3) If instead the user logs in to an existing account, the contact becomes associates with the
   existing user account instead; the contact becomes confirmed; his account becomes active if
   it was not already active; any project invites associated with the temporary account are
   transferred to the existing account; the temporary account is deleted; and the user is 
   logged in to his existing account
4) Any DeferredMessages associated with the now-confirmed Contact are reprocessed

== (3) Self-Initiated Email to Site from Unrecognized Contact ==

1) Somebody sends an email to the website, e.g. to post to a mailing list or request subscription
2) The email address is not associated with any existing contact
3) The message is stashed in a deferral queue
4) A new, inactive account is created with a random username and no usable password
5) An email is sent to the email address that initiated the message in the first place, 
   containing an unguessable link and an explanation that his message will be deferred
6) The user clicks on the link
7) The system confirms that the contact referenced by the link is confirmed; that the 
   associated account is inactive; and that the associated account does not have a password set
8) The user is presented with a form where he can set a username and password for his new
   account, or log in to an existing account and add this email address to that account
9) If the user sets a username and password for his new account, the user's username and password
   are set; the contact becomes confirmed; his account becomes active; and he is logged in
   immediately
0) If instead the user logs in to an existing account, the contact becomes associates with the
   existing user account instead; the contact becomes confirmed; his account becomes active if
   it was not already active; any project invites associated with the temporary account are
   transferred to the existing account; the temporary account is deleted; and the user is 
   logged in to his existing account
1) Any DeferredMessages associated with the now-confirmed Contact are reprocessed
